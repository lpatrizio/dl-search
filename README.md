# dl-search
Searching for and playing Youtube videos through the command line interface. Because I hated the new UI enough that I decided I wanted do see if I could do away with it entirely. Turns out you can.
Created through a combination of Youtube-dl for extracting videos, and mpv for playing them.

###  Searching for Videos
Basic mode. Just enter in the search term, then the amount of videos you want to find in the next prompt, and select the video

### Listing Videos from A Channel
Type in "c" at the first prompt, then type in the name of the channel. If it doesn't find the name on its own, a list will be presented of possible channels to select. Choose one. Afterwards, regardless of whether it found the channel or not, enter the amount of videos you want it to list. Then, select the correct one

### Playlists
By typing in "p" at the first prompt, the program will be able to play through an entire playlist if you give it the link. It is possible to select whether or not to shuffle the playlist, or start playing from a specific spot in the playlist.

### Exit
If you want to back out to basic mode at any time, type in "exit".
